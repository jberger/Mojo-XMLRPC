=head1 NAME

Mojo::XMLRPC - An XMLRPC message parser/encoder using the Mojo stack

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Mojo::UserAgent;
  use Mojo::XMLRPC qw[to_xmlrpc from_xmlrpc];

  my $ua = Mojo::UserAgent->new;
  my $url = ...;
  my $tx = $ua->post($url, encode_xmlrpc(request => 'mymethod', 'myarg'));
  my $res = decode_xmlrpc($tx->body)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojo::XMLRPC> is a pure-perl XML-RPC message parser and encoder.
It uses tools from the L<Mojo> toolkit to do all of the work.

This does not mean that it must only be used in conjunction with a L<Mojolicious> app, far from it.
Feel free to use it in any circumstance that needs XML-RPC messages.

=head1 THANKS

This module was inspired by L<XMLRPC::Fast> written by SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni.

L<Mojo::XMLRPC> was a port of that module initially to use the L<Mojo::DOM> module rather than L<XML::Parser>.
By the time port to the Mojo stack was complete, the module was entirely rewritten.
That said, the algorithm still owes a debt of gratitude to that one.
